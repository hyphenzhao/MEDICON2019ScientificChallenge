## Abstract

Abstract.Event-Related  Potential  (ERP)  based  Brain-Computer  In-terfaces  (BCI)  have  been  widely  investigated  as  an  alternative  humancomputer interaction solution. For people with neurological diseases andsevere  disabilities  like  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS)  and  stroke,BCI  may  be  their  only  access  method  for  communication.  For  peoplewith  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  such  as  autism  spectrum  disorder(ASD), BCI is also considered to be a potential rehabilitation and edu-cation assistance method. Although these are promising developments,further work is required to optimize current classification and filteringmethods to improve reliability and enhance the user experience. The aimof this project is to investigate the four most commonly used classifica-tion  algorithms:  Linear  Discriminant  Analysis  (LDA),  Support  VectorMachine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) with a novel and personalised filter design. Re-sults of the classification tasks in Phase I and Phase II, of the IFMBEScientific Challenge , show a 73% accuracy for phase I and 67% accuracyfor Phase II.
